- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kristoffer-Sundstroem, a PhD student in Economics at Luleå University of Technology.

- 👀 I’m interested in developing skills in R, Python and SQL.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic Python, basic SQL, more advanced data visualization in R (mainly ggplot and map applications) and Text analysis in R's Quanteda package.

- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything in particular at the moment. If you feel like I could contribute then reach out to me.

- 📫 I can be reached through my private e-mail: u.k.sundstroem@gmail.com
